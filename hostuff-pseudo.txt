/* 

	Antelope + Hotstuff = Roasted Antelope

	Roasted Antelope is a proposal for an upgrade to the Antelope consensus model, based on the Hotstuff protocol. This document defines extended pseudocode for this upgrade, and should be relatively straightforward to plug into the existing Antelope codebase.

	Notes: This pseudocode is based on algorithms 4 (safety) & 5 (liveness) of the "HotStuff: BFT Consensus in the Lens of Blockchain" paper.

	There are a few minor modifications to the pacemaker algorithm implementation, allowing to decompose the role of block producer into the 3 sub-roles of block proposer, block finalizer and view leader. 

	This pseudocode handles each role separately. A single entity may play multiple roles.

	This pseudocode also covers changes to the finalizer set, which include transition from and into dual_set mode.

	Under dual_set mode, the incumbent and the incoming finalizer sets are jointly confirming views.

	As is the case with the algorithm 4, the notion of view is almost completely decoupled from the safety protocol, and is aligned to the liveness protocol instead.

	Corresponds to onNextSyncView in hotstuff paper. Handles both leader rotations as well as timeout if leader fails to progress

	Note : for maximum liveness, on_leader_rotate() should be called by replicas as early as possible when either :
	 
	 1) no more blocks are expected before leader rotation occurs (eg: after receiving the final block expected from the current leader before the handoff) OR

	 2) if we reach (me._block_interval * (me._blocks_per_round - 1)) time into a specific view, and we haven't received the expected second to last block for this round.

	 In scenarios where liveness is maintained, this relieves an incoming leader from having to wait until it has received n - f new_view messages at the beginning of a new view since it will already have the highest qc.

	 In scenarios where liveness has been lost due to f + 1 faulty replicas, progress is impossible, so the safety rule rejects attempts at creating a qc until liveness has been restored.

	Proofs :

	Safety :

		Lemma 1. Let b and w be two conflicting block_candidates such that b.get_height() = w.get_height(), then they cannot both have valid quorum certificates.

		Proof. Suppose they can, so both b and w receive 2f + 1 votes, among which there are at least f + 1 honest replicas
		voting for each block_candidate, then there must be an honest replica that votes for both, which is impossible because b and w
		are of the same height.

		This is enforced by the function labeled "Lemma 1".

		Lemma 2. Let b and w be two conflicting block_candidates. Then they cannot both become committed, each by an honest replica.

		Proof. We prove this lemma by contradiction. Let b and w be two conflicting block_candidates at different heights.
		Assume during an execution, b becomes committed at some honest replica via the QC Three-Chain b.

		For this to happen, b must be the parent and justification of b1, b1 must be the parent and justification of b2 and b2 must be the justification of a new proposal b_new.

		Likewise w becomes committed at some honest replica via the QC Three-Chain w.

		For this to happen, w must be the parent and justification of w1, w1 must be the parent and justification of w2 and w2 must be the justification of a new proposal w_new.

		By lemma 1, since each of the block_candidates b, b1, b2, w, w1, w2 have QCs, then without loss of generality, we assume b.get_height() > w2.get_height().

		We now denote by qc_s the QC for a block_candidate with the lowest height larger than w2.get_height(), that conflicts with w.

		Assuming such qc_s exists, for example by being the justification for b1. Let r denote a correct replica in the intersection of w_new.justify and qc_s. By assumption of minimality of qc_s, the lock that r has on w is not changed before qc_s is formed. Now, consider the invocation of on_proposal_received with a message carrying a conflicting block_candidate b_new such that b_new.block_id = qc_s.block_id. By assumption, the condition on the lock (see line labeled "Lemma 2") is false.

		On the other hand, the protocol requires t = b_new.justifty to be an ancestor of b_new. By minimality of qc_s, t.get_height() <= w2.get_height(). Since qc_s.block_id conflicts with w.block_id, t cannot be any of w, w1 or w2. Then, t.get_height() < w.get_height() so the other half of the disjunct is also false. Therefore, r will not vote for b_new, contradicting the assumption of r.

		Theorem 3. Let cmd1 and cmd2 be any two commands where cmd1 is executed before cmd2 by some honest replica, then any honest replica that executes cmd2 must execute cm1 before cmd2.

		Proof. Denote by w the node that carries cmd1, b carries cmd2. From Lemma 1, it is clear the committed nodes are at distinct heights. Without loss of generality, assume w.get_height() < b.height(). The commitment of w and b are handled by commit(w1) and commit(b1) in update(), where w is an ancestor of w1 and b is an ancestor of b1. According to Lemma 2, w1 must not conflict with b1, so w does not conflict with b. Then, w is an ancestor of b, and when any honest replica executes b, it must first execute w by the recursive logic in commit().

	Liveness :

		In order to prove liveness, we first show that after GST, there is a bounded duration T_f such that if all correct replicas remain in view v during T_f and the leader for view v is correct, then a decision is reached. We define qc_1 and qc_2 as matching QCs if qc_1 and qc_2 are both valid and qc_1.block_id = qc_2.block_id.

		Lemma 4. If a correct replica is locked such that me._b_lock.justify = generic_qc_2, then at least f + 1 correct replicas voted for some generic_qc_1 matching me._b_lock.justify.

		Proof. Suppose replica r is locked on generic_qc_2. Then, (n-f) votes were cast for the matching generic_qc_1 in an earlier phase (see line labeled "Lemma 4"), out of which at least f + 1 were from correct replicas.

		Theorem 5. After GST, there exists a bounded time period T_f such that if all correct replicas remain in view v during
		T_f and the leader for view v is correct, then a decision is reached.

		Proof. Starting in a new view, the leader has collected (n − f) new_view or vote messages and calculates its high_qc before
		broadcasting a qc message. Suppose among all replicas (including the leader itself), the highest kept lock
		is me._b_lock.justify = generic_qc_new_2.

		By Lemma 4, we know there are at least f + 1 correct replicas that voted for a generic_qc_new_1 matching generic_qc_new_2, and have already sent them to the leader in their new_view or vote messages. Thus, the leader must learn a matching generic_qc_new_2 in at least one of these new_view or vote messages and use it as high_qc in its initial qc message for this view. By the assumption, all correct replicas are synchronized in their view and the leader is non-faulty. Therefore, all correct replicas will vote at a specific height, since in is_node_safe(), the condition on the line labeled "Liveness check" is satisfied. This is also the case if the block_id in the message conflicts with a replica’s stale me._b_lock.justify.block_id, such that the condition on the line labeled "Safety check" is evaluated to false. 

		Then, after the leader has a valid generic_qc for this view, all replicas will vote at all the following heights, leading to a new commit decision at every step. After GST, the duration T_f for the steps required to achieve finality is of bounded length.

		The protocol is Optimistically Responsive because there is no explicit “wait-for-∆” step, and the logical disjunction in is_node_safe() is used to override a stale lock with the help of the Three-Chain paradigm.

	Accountability and finality violation :

		Let us define b_descendant as a descendant of b_root, such that hotstuff.extends(b_descendant, b_root) returns true.

		Suppose b_descendant's block header includes a high_qc field representing a 2f + 1 vote on b_root. When we become aware of a new block where the high_qc points to b_descendant or to one of b_descendant's descendants, we know b_root, as well as all of b_root's ancestors, have been committed and are final.

		Theorem 6. Let b_root and w_root be two conflicting block_candidates of the same height, such that hotstuff.extends(b_root, w_root) and hotstuff.extends(w_root, b_root) both return false, and that b_root.get_height() == w_root.get_height(). Then they cannot each have a valid quorum certificate unless a finality violation has occurred. In the case of such finality violation, any party in possession of b_root and w_root would be able to prove complicity or exonerate block finalizers having taken part or not in causing the finality violation.

		Proof. Let b_descendant and w_descendant be descendants of respectively b_root and w_root, such that hotstuff.extends(b_descendant, b_root) and hotstuff.extends(w_descendant, w_root) both return true.

		By Lemma 1, we know that a correct replica cannot sign two conflicting block candidates at the same height.

		For each of b_root and w_root, we can identify and verify the signatures of finalizers, by ensuring the justification's agg_sig matches the aggregate key calculated from the sig_bitset and the schedule.

		Therefore, for b_root and w_root to both be included as qc justification into descendant blocks, at least one correct replica must have signed two vote messages on conflicting block candidates at the same height, which is impossible due to the checks performed in the function with comment "Lemma 1". Such an event would be a finality violation.

		For a finality violation to occur, the intersection of the finalizers that have voted for both b_root and w_root, as evidenced by the high_qc of b_descendant and w_descendant must represent a minimum of f + 1 faulty nodes.

		By holding otherwise valid blocks where a qc for b_root and w_root exist, the finality violation can be proved trivially, simply by calculating the intersection and the symmetrical difference of the finalizer sets having voted for these two proposals. The finalizers contained in the intersection can therefore be blamed for the finality violation. The symmetric difference of finalizers that have voted for either proposal but not for both can be exonerated from wrong doing, thus satisfying the Accountability property requirement.

	Finalizer set transition (safety proof) :

		Replicas can operate in either single_set or dual_set validation mode. In single_set mode, quorum is calculated and evaluated only for the active finalizer set. In dual_set mode, independant quorums are calculated over each of the active (incumbent) finalizer set and the incoming finalizer set, and are evaluated separately. 

		Let us define active_set as the active finalizer set, as determined by the pacemaker at any given point while a replica is operating in single_set mode. The active_set is known to all active replicas that are in sync. While operating in single_set mode, verification of quorum on proposals is achieved through the use of the active_set.quorum_met() predicate.

		Let us define incumbent_set and incoming_set as, respectively, the previously active_set and a new proposed set of finalizers, starting at a point in time when a replica becomes aware of a quorum on a block containing a finalizer set transition proposal. This triggers the transition into dual_set mode for this replica.

		As the replica is operating in dual_set mode, the quorum_met() predicate used in single_set mode is temporarily replaced with the extended_quorum_met() predicate, which only returns true if (incumbent_set.quorum_met() AND incoming_set.quorum_met()).

		As we demonstrated in Lemma 1, Lemma 2 and Theorem 3, the protocol is safe when n - f correct replicas achieve quorum on proposals.

		Therefore, no safety is lost as we are transitioning into dual_set mode, since this transition only adds to the quorum constraints guaranteeing safety. However, this comes at the cost of decreased plausible liveness, because of the additional constraint of also requiring the incoming finalizer set to reach quorum in order to progress. //todo : discuss possible recovery from incoming finalizer set liveness failure
		
		Theorem 7. A replica can only operate in either single_set mode or in dual_set mode. While operating in dual_set mode, the constraints guaranteeing safety of single_set mode still apply, and thus the dual_set mode constraints guaranteeing safety can only be equally or more restrictive than when operating in single_set mode.

		Proof. Suppose a replica is presented with a proposal b_new, which contains a qc on a previous proposal b_old such that hotstuff.extends(b_new, b_old) returns true, and that the replica could operate in both single_set mode and dual_set mode at the same time, in such a way that active_set == incumbent_set and that an unknown incoming_set also exists. 

		As it needs to verify the qc, the replica invokes both quorum_met() and extended_quorum_met() predicates.

		It follows that, since active_set == incumbent_set, and that active_set.quorum_met() is evaluated in single_set mode, and incumbent_set.quorum_met() is evaluated as part of the extended_quorum_met() predicate in dual_set mode, the number of proposals where (incumbent_set.quorum_met() AND incoming_set.quorum_met()) is necessarily equal or smaller than the number of proposals where active_set.quorum_met(). In addition, any specific proposal where active_set.quorum_met() is false would also imply (incumbent_set.quorum_met() AND incoming_set.quorum_met()) is false as well.

		Therefore, the safety property is not weakened while transitioning into dual_set mode.
