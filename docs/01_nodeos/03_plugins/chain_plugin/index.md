## Description

The `chain_plugin` is a core plugin required to process and aggregate chain data on an Antelope node.

## Usage

```console
# config.ini
plugin = eosio::chain_plugin
[options]
```
```sh
# command-line
nodeos ... --plugin eosio::chain_plugin [operations] [options]
```

## Operations

These can only be specified from the `nodeos` command-line:
