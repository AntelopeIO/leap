## Description

The `producer_plugin` loads functionality required for a node to produce blocks.

[[info]]
| Additional configuration is required to produce blocks. Please read [Configuring Block Producing Node](../../02_usage/02_node-setups/00_producing-node.md).

## Usage

```console
# config.ini
plugin = eosio::producer_plugin [options]
```
```sh
# nodeos startup params
nodeos ... -- plugin eosio::producer_plugin [options]
```

## Options

These can be specified from both the `nodeos` command-line or the `config.ini` file:

```console
Config Options for eosio::producer_plugin:
  -e [ --enable-stale-production ]      Enable block production, even if the
                                        chain is stale.
  -x [ --pause-on-startup ]             Start this node in a state where
                                        production is paused
  --max-transaction-time arg (=499)     Setting this value (in milliseconds)
                                        will restrict the allowed transaction
                                        execution time to a value potentially
                                        lower than the on-chain consensus
                                        max_transaction_cpu_usage value.
  --max-irreversible-block-age arg (=-1)
                                        Limits the maximum age (in seconds) of

                                        this node will produce blocks on (use
