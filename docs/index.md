EOSIO is the next-generation blockchain platform for creating and deploying smart contracts and distributed applications. EOSIO comes with a number of programs. The primary ones included in EOSIO are the following:

* [Nodeos](01_nodeos/index.md) - Core service daemon that runs a node for block production, API endpoints, or local development.
* [Cleos](02_cleos/index.md) - Command line interface to interact with the blockchain (via `nodeos`) and manage wallets (via `keosd`).
* [Keosd](03_keosd/index.md) - Component that manages EOSIO keys in wallets and provides a secure enclave for digital signing.

The basic relationship between these components is illustrated in the diagram below.
